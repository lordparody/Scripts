# Scripts


This will be where I dump some of my scripts and shells for use in my OSCP and CTF challenge work. Most of these will be someone elses work stored for easy access ( Credit will be given to each script to any original authors, at least links to the original location it was found for those with no known authors ).

let me know if anything here is yours and uncredited.  parody [at] lordparody.com
